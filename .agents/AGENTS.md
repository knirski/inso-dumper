# Skill Maintenance

The repository-root `AGENTS.md` still applies. These rules govern `.agents/`.

- During scheduled maintenance and before template releases, run
  `npx skills update -p`. Do not update skills automatically during ordinary
  skill use.
- Review every update before accepting it. Preserve local adaptations, and use
  `NOTICE.md` to check upstream sources, licenses, and attribution; update it
  when those facts change.
- For skills not managed by the CLI, reconcile updates directly with the
  upstream source recorded in `NOTICE.md`.
- When reviewing upstream updates to `loop-on-ci` or `pr-review-loop`, first
  compare each repository copy with its upstream copy (`diff -u`) and review
  every hunk before applying it. Treat the repository-root `AGENTS.md` pull-
  request gate as a local contract: preserve substantive feedback from
  automated reviewers, invoke `loop-on-ci` after every pushed review fix and
  before replying to or resolving that feedback, require green PR-attached
  checks before stopping or resuming review work, and re-fetch feedback after
  each CI cycle. If upstream removes or weakens any of these behaviors,
  manually patch around the upstream change while accepting unrelated updates.
  Re-check `NOTICE.md`, `skills-lock.json`, callers, and the path-scoped diff
  after reconciliation; change provenance or lock metadata only when the
  accepted upstream source or version changed.
- Before editing, read the complete `SKILL.md`, required references, callers,
  and current diff.
- Keep frontmatter valid: `name` matches the directory, and `description`
  states concrete triggers rather than summarizing the workflow. Keep paths
  and cross-references current.
- Test changes to triggers, decisions, required steps, safety rules, or output
  with the same fresh-context scenario before and after editing. Use focused
  checks for mechanical-only changes.
- Validate changed examples and Python scripts with the repository's uv-managed checks. The
  repository does not support Bash scripts or ShellCheck.
- Before completion, run `python3.14 tests/test_template_contract.py` and inspect the
  path-scoped diff.
- Never add credentials, local settings, generated agent state, or unrelated
  upstream changes.

## Skill install scope

This repository tracks skills in exactly two agent directories:

- `.agents/skills/<skill>/` -- real files; the single source of truth for skill
  content.
- `.claude/skills/<skill>` -- a symlink to `../../.agents/skills/<skill>`
  (git mode `120000`), so Claude Code reads the same content without a copy.

`npx skills update -p` auto-limits to the agent mappings already present
(Universal + Claude Code), so it touches only `.agents/` and `.claude/`. It is
safe to run unchanged.

`npx skills add ... --all` is NOT safe here: it installs into ~76 agent
directories (`.aider-desk`, `.augment`, `.bob`, `data/`, `skills/`, ...), only
two of which (`agents`, `claude`) this repository tracks. Never use `--all`.
Scope adds to the two tracked mirrors, write real files under `.agents/`
(`--copy`), and make the `.claude/skills/<name>` entry a symlink -- not a real
directory -- so it matches the existing layout. After any `add`, remove every
untracked top-level agent directory it created before considering the change
complete.

## Patching Atelier skills

When an Atelier skill update is available:

1. Run `npx skills update -p` only during scheduled maintenance or before a template release.
2. Inspect the proposed diff and compare each changed skill with its upstream source recorded in
   `NOTICE.md`; do not accept a wholesale overwrite.
3. Apply the upstream change to the matching `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, then reapply local
   adaptations deliberately. Preserve repository-specific instructions, examples, paths, and
   cross-references unless the upstream change intentionally replaces them.
4. If the update changes a skill name, trigger, required step, caller, or referenced path, update
   all affected callers and guidance in the same patch. If provenance, licensing, or attribution
   changes, update `NOTICE.md` before accepting the skill update.
5. For changes to triggers, decisions, required steps, safety rules, or output, run the same
   fresh-context scenario against the old and new behavior. For mechanical changes, run focused
   contract checks instead.
6. Run `python3.14 tests/test_template_contract.py`, the relevant uv-managed checks, and inspect
   the path-scoped diff before completion.

For a skill not managed by the CLI, use the same review and preservation process against the
upstream source named in `NOTICE.md`, editing the repository copy directly.
